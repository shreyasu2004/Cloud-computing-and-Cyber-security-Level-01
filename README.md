<h4>My Tech Learning Journey</h4>

Welcome to my repository! This contains the projects and concepts I’ve been exploring as I learn different technologies. From **JavaScript fundamentals** to **asynchronous programming**, **cloud computing**, and **cybersecurity**, this repository includes hands-on work and exercises that showcase the skills I've acquired.

## Projects & Concepts

### 1. **JavaScript Basics**
I began my journey by learning JavaScript's core concepts:
- **Variables**: Understanding how to store and manipulate data.
- **Functions**: Writing reusable code with function definitions.
- **Loops**: Using loops to iterate through data and perform repetitive tasks.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Creating interactive webpages and making dynamic changes to the DOM.

**Example Project:**
- **Student Marks Calculator**: I created a simple webpage where users can input student names and marks. JavaScript is used to calculate each student’s percentage, the class average, and rank students based on their scores.

### 2. **Asynchronous JavaScript (Async JS)**
To handle non-blocking code, I explored **asynchronous programming** in JavaScript:
- **Callbacks**: I used callbacks to manage the flow of asynchronous tasks.
  
**Example Project:**
- **Recipe Steps Program**: I created a program to display the steps of a Jamun recipe asynchronously, demonstrating how callbacks can be used to manage multiple tasks in sequence.

---

### 3. **Promises in JavaScript**
Building on my asynchronous JavaScript knowledge, I dove into **Promises**:
- Promises provide a more readable and manageable way to handle asynchronous tasks compared to callbacks.
- I learned how to chain promises and handle success or failure with `.then()` and `.catch()` methods.

**Example Learning:**
- **Handling Multiple Async Tasks**: I created examples to understand promise chaining and error handling.

### 4. **Introduction to Cloud Computing**
Cloud computing enables businesses and individuals to store and manage data over the internet instead of using local devices. I explored:
- **Service Models**:
  - **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Provides virtualized computing resources online (e.g., AWS EC2).
  - **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Provides a platform for building applications without managing infrastructure (e.g., Google App Engine).
  - **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Delivers software applications over the internet (e.g., Google Workspace, Dropbox).

- **Deployment Models**:
  - **Public Cloud**: Shared resources hosted by third-party providers.
  - **Private Cloud**: Dedicated to a single organization.
  - **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private clouds for greater flexibility.

---

### 5. **Introduction to Cybersecurity**
Cybersecurity is vital in protecting systems and data. I covered:
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)**: Key principles of cybersecurity.
- **Common Threats**: Malware, phishing, and social engineering tactics used by attackers.
- **Encryption Techniques**:
  - **Caesar Cipher**: Basic encryption through letter shifting.
  - **Morse Code**: A system for encoding text using dots and dashes.
  - **Polybius Cipher**: A substitution cipher using a grid.

**Example Learning:**
- I experimented with encoding text using different encryption methods to understand basic cryptography.

---

### 6. **Command Line Tools**
Getting familiar with the **command line** has been a crucial part of my learning:
- **Basic Directory and File Operations**:
  - Created directories, navigated between directories, and managed files using commands like `mkdir`, `cd`, and `cat`.
  
- **Text Editing with Vi**: Learned how to use the `vi` editor for creating and editing text files in a terminal.
  
- **Piping & Regex**: Utilized tools like `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` for text searching and manipulation with regular expressions.

---

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML/CSS**
- **Cloud Computing (AWS, Google Cloud)**
- **Cybersecurity Concepts**
- **Linux Command Line (bash, Vi, regex)**
